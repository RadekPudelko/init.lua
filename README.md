# init.lua

My neovim config, currently set for embedded development for Particle.io devices. Based on https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua

Clone this to `~/.config/nvim`

Run the Packer quickstart install: https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim

Make sure to install:
> bear: https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear

> ripgrep: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

Particle Device OS is managed by Particle Workbench extension in VSCode

LSP for Particle comes from compile_commands.json which is generated by bear via my makefile + clangd (llvm)
